# Birth Death Trees
Scripts for characterization and evaluation of summary statistics for phylogenetic trees.

The main script is run_experiments.py. This script generates a database containing the result of multiple summary statistics for different simulated phhylogenetic trees. Once the database is generated, the build_report.py script generates a pdf file with a group of figures that can be helpful for analysis.
